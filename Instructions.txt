    0. Up until you completed "Check your MinGW installation", follow the instructions at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw
    Note: after doing the above once, you won't have to do them again.
    1. In explorer, open the folder this text file and all the other files are in (probably open given you are reading this)

    3. Press alt + d
    4. Type cmd and hit enter
    5. Right click, this should paste what you copied
    6. Press enter and wait, it may take a few minutes
    7. Enjoy your exe file, unless you got an error, in which case enjoy debugging
Linux:
